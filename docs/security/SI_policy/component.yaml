      18F tests software updates against a staging environment for any updates, including those related to flaw remediation, for effectiveness and potential side effects before deploying the updates to production environment.
      Cloud Foundry manages software vulnerability using releases and BOSH stemcells.
      New Cloud Foundry releases are created with updates to address code issues, while new
      stemcells are created with patches for the latest security fixes to address
      any underlying operating system issues. New Cloud Foundry releases are located
      at https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release.
