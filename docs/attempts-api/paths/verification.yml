        The 400 (Bad Request) status code indicates that the server cannot or
        will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be
        a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request
        message framing, or deceptive request routing).
    401:
      description: |
        The 401 (Unauthorized) status code indicates that the request has not
        been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for
        the target resource. Please ensure that the request includes a valid Bearer token.

        The 403 (Forbidden) status code indicates that the server understood
        the request but refuses to authorize it. Please reach out to your account manager
        if you think this is a mistake.
