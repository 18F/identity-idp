  narrative: "#### a  \n18F has developed the system security plan (SSP) for an Identity\
    \ Platform Service containing the information security architecture for the information\
    \ system that:\nDescribes the overall philosophy, requirements, and approach to\
    \ be taken with regard to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability\
    \ of organizational information\nDescribes how the information security architecture\
    \ is integrated into and supports the enterprise architecture\nDescribes any information\
    \ security assumptions about, and dependencies on, external services\n  \n####\
    \ b  \n18F Reviews and updates the information security architecture within the\
    \ System Security plans and the 18F GitHub repository on an annual basis or when\
    \ a significant change takes place to reflect updates in the enterprise architecture.\n\
    Due to the dynamic and elastic nature of cloud computing,  18F monitors real-time\
    \ updates of its information security architecture using its infrastructure management\
    \  and visual security consoles.\n  \n#### c  \n18F ensures that planned information\
    \ security architecture changes are reflected in the security plan and organizational\
    \ procurements/acquisitions.\n18F follows the risk management framework (RMF)\
    \ which includes conducting annual risk assessments for its information systems\
    \ and infrastructure. Any changes are then updated in systems security plans,\
    \ plan of actions and milestones POA&Ms, security assessment reports (SAR)\n \
