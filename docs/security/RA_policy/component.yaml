  narrative: "#### a  \n18F Conducts monthly Operating System (OS) and web application\
    \ scanning; quarterly database scanning; and, OS and Web application scanning\
    \ with every code release. 18F conducts internal vulnerabilty scanning of its\
    \ VPC and private subnets within the 18F Virtual Private Cloud.\n  \n#### b  \n\
    18F vulnerabilty scanning toos utilize techniques that promote interoperability\
    \ such as Common Vulnerability Scoring System v2 (CVSS2), Common Platform Enumeration\
    \ (CPE), and Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE) and OWASP TOP 10 vulnerabilities.\n\
    \  \n#### c  \n18F Analyzes vulnerability scan reports from its vulnerabilty scanning\
    \ tools assessments at least weekly and appropriate actions taken on discovery\
    \ of vulnerabilities within the 18F Cloud Infrastructure and applications and\
    \ from security control assessments conducted on its information systems.\n  \n\
    #### d  \nHigh-risk vulnerabilities are mitigated within thirty days (30); moderate\
    \ risk vulnerabilities mitigated within ninety days (90). If the recommended steps\
    \ will adversely impact functionality or performance, the ISSO/ISSM will reviews\
    \ changes and mitigating controls with 18F DevOps as well as the Cloud Foundry\
    \ system owners.\n  \n#### e  \n18F shares information obtained from the vulnerability\
    \ scanning process and security control assessments with designated System Owners,\
    \ DevOPs, GSA SecOps, ISSM and the Authorizing Official (AO) to help eliminate\
    \ similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses\
    \ or deficiencies).\n  \n"
