  narrative: "18F will replace information system components when support for the\
    \ components is no longer available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer;\
    \ and will provide justification and documents approval for the continued use\
    \ of unsupported system components required to satisfy mission/business needs.\n\
    Cloud Foundry Platform as a Service system replacement:\nA system & software inventory\
    \ is run nightly, and the DevOps team reviews the inventory weekly to ensure that\
    \ all software inventoried is accurate and currently supported.  This process\
    \ includes:\nVerify that the software license support expiration date is not within\
    \ six months. 18F uses the open source version of Cloud Foundry which uses the\
    \ open source Apache 2.0 license.\nEnsure that the software version is still supported.\
    \  Refer to the vendor's support website to verify that support does not have\
    \ an \u201CEnd of Life\u201D date of less than six months.\nSince 18F is using\
    \ the open source version of Cloud Foundry, an additional task will be issued\
    \ to upgrade Cloud Foundry suite to the latest versions. DevOps will review the\
    \ GitHub cloudfoundry/cf-release repository for implementation of the updated\
    \ version.\n"
