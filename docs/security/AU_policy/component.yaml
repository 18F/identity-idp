    \ and continuous monitoring.\n18F will generate and distribute audit reports,\
    \ provide customized dashoard access for audited events, and send audit log data\

    18F retains audit logs according to NARA retention standards to provide support\
    \ for after-the-fact investigations of security incidents and to meet regulatory\
    \ and organizational information retention requirements.\nThe log management framework\
    \ will provide the capability to retain logs for 90 days online and one-year offline,\
    \ with sufficient capacity as to mitigate the risk of exceeding storage space.\n\
    Specific Policies, Procedures, Points of Contact, and Guidance will be established\
    \ between 18F and other agencies to support after-the-fact investigations, by\

    can structure and customize audit logs queries to specific app instances, API
    calls, system metrics, user access, system components, network traffic flow and
    other functions. Kibana is used to generate customized dashboards and Logstash
    to generate reports for analysis and review.
