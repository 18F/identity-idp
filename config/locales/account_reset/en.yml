      delete_account_info:
      - Deleting your existing account and creating a new one will allow you to use
        the same email address and set up new authentication methods. However, deleting
        will remove any agency applications you have linked to your account and you
        will need to restore each connection.
      - If you continue, you will first receive an email confirmation.  As a security
        measure, you will receive another email with the link to continue deleting
        your account 24 hours after the initial confirmation email arrives.
      info:
      - If you can’t access your account using the authentication methods you set
        up previously, deleting your account and creating a new one is the only option.
      - We can’t undo an account delete, so please verify if you have another authentication
        method you can use instead.
