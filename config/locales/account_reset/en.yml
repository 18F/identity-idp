      delete_account_info: Deleting your existing account and creating a new one will
        allow you to use the same email address and set up new authentication methods.  However,
        deleting will remove any agency applications you have linked to your account
        and you will need to restore each connection. <br><br> If you continue, you
        will first receive an email confirmation.  As a security measure, you will
        receive another email with the link to continue deleting your account 24 hours
        after the initial confirmation email arrives.
      info: If you can't access your account using the authentication methods you
        set up previously, deleting your account and creating a new one is the only
        option. <br><br> We can't undo an account delete, so please verify if you
        have another authentication method you can use instead.
