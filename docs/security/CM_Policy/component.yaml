        All Configuration Change control:
        18F provisions its infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation, the AWS CloudFormation
        template describes exactly what resources are provisioned and their settings.
        Because these templates are text files, 18F can simply track differences in
        these templates to track changes to its infrastructure, similar to the way
        developers control revisions to source code.

        18F uses version control systems with its cloud formation templates to know
        exactly what changes were made, who made them, and when. If at any point 18F
        needs to reverse changes to infrastructure, you can use a previous version of
        a template.

        18F uses GitHub for additional tracking and documenting of authorized changes
        within the infrastructure and applications including Cloud Foundry platform as
        a service. Within GitHub, a diff function is used to compare and contrast any
        changes made to configurations of Cloud Foundry.

        18F reviews proposed configuration-controlled changes to all of its information
        systems and infrastructure and approves or disapproves such changes with explicit
        consideration for security impact analysis within the Virtual Private Cloud
        environment. All reviews and approvals are conducted within 18Fs GitHub ticketing
        and tracking system.

        18F uses the following methods to document configuration change decisions
        associated with its information systems.  For changes related to the its
        virtual infrastructure, 18F uses VisualOps and Cloud Checkr for real-time
        configuration changes which are documented, approved and tracked within GitHub.
        All Cloud Foundry configuration changes are documented, approved and tracked
        within 18F's GitHub site.  All configuration changes related to applications
        and websites hosted within the 18F AWS and Cloud Foundry environment are
        requested by the systems owner and approved by DevOps within the 18F GitHub
        tracking systems.

        When configuration changes have been approved through 18F's GitHub
        ticketing and tracking system, the DevOps team implements approved configuration-controlled
        changes to the information system and then provides a status of the changes
        completed and closes out the ticket.
    - key: e

        Records of configuration-controlled
        changes are retained for at least 1 year in accordance with the 18F Configuration
        Management policy and utilizing the 18F GitHub site and S3 to store all changes
        requested, approved, disapproved, implemented and pending.

        Audits for the virtual infrastructure and Cloud Foundry platform as a
        service and applications are conducted by DevOps, ISSOs and Cloud Foundry
        project manager of all configuration-controlled changes to the information
        system.  These audits take place no less than once a month and are documented
        in the GitHub ticketing and tracking system, per the 18F Configuration
        management policy Section 3 which states

        18F will conduct a monthly audit of information system which identifies and
        eliminates unnecessary functions, ports, protocols, and/or services.

        18F coordinates
        and provides oversight for configuration change control activities through its
        GitHub tracking and ticketing systems and Slack communications channel which
        is integrated with GitHub that convenes whenever there are significant and pending
        changes to the 18F security, cloud infrastructure and applications.

        18F uses established and documents configuration settings
        for its information technology products employed within the Cloud Foundry platform
        that reflect the most restrictive mode consistent with operational requirements.
        18F follows industry best practices and guidance provided in NIST Special Publication
        800-70, Security Configuration Checklist Program for IT Products

        Infrastructure documented configuration settings:
        DevOps and Security Engineers maintain the
        baseline configuration for VPC, EBS and AMIs.  Best practices, FISMA compliant
        AMIs, and hardened cloud formation templates are utilized as there are no benchmarks
        available. 18F uses the following approved FISMA ready baselines located at
        https://github.com/fisma-ready

        Cloud Foundry documented configuration settings:
        18F follows Cloud Foundry best practices for configuring and implementing the
        platform as a service. Configuration settings are documented within the deployment
        manifest on the GitHub and Cloud Foundry websites. The following are approved
        baseline configuration settings related to the Cloud Foundry platform as a service.
        All documented configuration settings  related to Cloud Foundry are located
        at https://docs.18f.gov/ops/repos/.

        18F Implements the configuration
        settings based on its documented process and practices. DevOps implements the
        configuration benchmarks identified in Part a, maintains the baseline configuration
        for all cloud infrastructure and Cloud Foundry components and is responsible
        for ensuring all systems are configured in accordance with applicable hardening
        guides.

        DevOps documents any exceptions to established baseline
        configurations for all of 18F's virtual infrastructure and information systems.
        18F maintains exception documents which detail specific items from the established
        configuration settings which cannot be applied to instances due to operational
        requirements.

        18F Monitors and controls changes to the configuration
        settings in accordance with its documented configuration management policy and
        procedures.

        All Configuration Change Control:
        DevOps and 18F system owners maintain the baseline configurations within
        18F Virtual Private Cloud. Configuration will be reviewed in real-time using
        automated methods and at least quarterly to ensure no unauthorized changes
        were made to the baseline configuration.

        Internal vulnerability scans are performed at least on a quarterly basis in the
        event that no enhancements or upgrades are performed.

        18F posts its current inventory of information systems on its dashboard
        located at  https://18f.gsa.gov/dashboard/. Several sources are used to capture
        complete inventories of the virtual infrastructure and its information systems
        while providing the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting.
        The AWS Management Console, VisualOps, Cloud Checkr, Github, and Nexpose are used
        to provide additional enumeration capabilities.

        Cloud Checkr is currently deployed to facilitate asset management, along with
        other operations activities, on a real-time ongoing basis. Components deployed
        in the virtual infrastructure are accurately inventoried and can be filtered to
        a specific informaton system groups as well as a group of web services or  those
        components that are related to a spcecific informaton system.

        The VisualOps Cloud management tool is used to provide a visual, real-time and
        automated representation of the virtual infrastructure and applications within
        the 18F environment. It also provides a global view of the 18F AWS account where
        all regions and services can be seen in one place.

        The 18F GitHub repository also is used to show a current lists of components
        that make up the Login.gov inventory. It is located at https://docs.Login.gov/ops/repos/

        Nexpose maintains an inventory of all assets scanned within the 18F virtual Private
        Cloud. This includes all information system within the VPCs and components within
        the Login.gov platform as a service.

        SecOps and DevOps reviews and updates the information system component inventory
        on a monthly basis and updates the inventory of information system whenever installations,
        removals, and other changes are made. 18F will verify that all components within
        the authorized boundary of the information system are either inventoried as part
        of the system or recognized by another system as a component within that systems
        inventory.
