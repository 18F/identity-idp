  # This class iteratively looks up networks of users who are sharing devices.
  # It does this by first looking up the devices for a set of users.
  # Then it looks at all of the users who have signed in from those devices.
  # If a user who has not had their devices looked up is present, it looks up
  # the devices for that user.
  # This process is done iteratively until all devices and users within a
  # network are found.
