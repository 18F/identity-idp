  # This method reduces a list of URIs into a reasonable list for the form
  # action CSP directive on a page that may redirect to a service provider.
  #
  # It is necessary to include a list of destinations because some browsers
  # enforce the form action directive on redirects. For example, an SP may have
  # a redirect uri of `https://auth.example.com/result` that then redirects to
  # `https://app.example.com/`. The redirect will violate the IDP's CSP if
  # `https://app.example.com` is not included as a form action destination.
  #
  # Validations on the service provider ensure there will be 2 types of URLs
  # this method must handle:
  # - Web URLs
  # - Native app URLs
  #
  # Web URLs need to appear in the form action directive with a scheme, host,
  # and port. As such, `https://example.com/auth/result` and
  # `https://example.com/other/path` can be reduced to `https://example.com`.
  #
  # Native app URLs are for deep links to mobile applications. They will have
  # custom schemes and simple hostnames, such as `mymobileapp://result`. These
  # URLs need to be reduced to allow the scheme, but the host information will
  # need to be removed or some browsers will reject them. In the
  # `mymobileapp://result` example the URI must be reduced to `mymobileapp://`.
