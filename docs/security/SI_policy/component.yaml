  narrative: "#### a  \nThe 18F DevOps and SecOps teams monitors the Cloud.Gov information\
    \ system to detect potential attacks and intrusions from internal and external\
    \ sources in accordance with the 18F System Information and Integrity Policy section\
    \ 3 - Information System monitoring, the FedRAMP Incident communication procedures\
    \ and GSA CIO-IT Security-08-39 section \u201CSystem Monitoring / Audit Record\
    \ Review \u201C for GSA specifc infomation systems\n  \n#### b  \n18F identifies\
    \ un-authorized access to the Cloud.Gov information system using   automated monitoring\
    \ tools within its virutal proviate cloud for monitoringing, log management and\
    \ event analysis. 18F monitors for attacks and indicators of potential attacks,\
    \  unauthorized local, network, and remote connections.\n  \n#### c  \nThe infrastructure\
    \ that hosts Cloud.Gov provides monitoring and intrusion detcetion of unsual activity\
    \ at  the phyical and network layers. 18F is responsible for monitoring everything\
    \ related to its virtual infrastructure and has deployed monitoring  and intrusion\
    \ dectction tools within its virtual private cloud to log and dectect malicious\
    \ activities to its information systems including Cloud.Gov.\n  \n#### d  \n18F\
    \ ensures intrusion and monitoring tools are protected  from unauthorized access\
    \ by only granting access to certian members from the DevOps and SecOps team.\
    \ All monitoring and intrusion information data is protected by limiting accounts\
    \ to authorized privileged users only and is maintained in secured repositories\
    \ for review by those members.\n  \n#### e  \nInformation system monitoring will\
    \ be heightened based on advisories from Pivitol, US-CERT Advisories, commercial\
    \ security communities, and other sources.\n  \n#### f  \nInformation system monitoring\
    \ will be conducted in accordance and compliance with 18F security policies and\
    \ all applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, and regulations.\n  \n####\
    \ g  \n18F provides monitoring of all information system components in the event\
    \ of an event or incident, information will be provided as it is available.  Scheduled\
    \ reports will be provided for events such as after-hours administrative logins,\
    \ users being added to privileged groups, persistent malware detections, etc.\
    \ to designated members of the DevOps teams and SecOps teams as needed\n  \n"
