# `@18f/identity-manageable-authenticator`

Custom element for inline management of an authentication method.

## Usage

### Custom Element

Importing the element will register the `<lg-manageable-authenticator>` custom element:

```ts
import '@18f/identity-manageable-authenticator/manageable-authenticator-element';
```

The custom element will implement all JavaScript behaviors for the element, but the `<lg-manageable-authenticator>` markup must already exist.
