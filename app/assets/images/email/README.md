# Email Images

This folder contains images for exclusive use by mailer templates. This includes email-specific imagery, and also variants of existing assets.

For example, since [SVG images are not well-supported](https://www.caniemail.com/features/image-svg/) in all email clients, this folder may include rasterized versions of common SVG images.

These images should not be used in application views, since vector images (SVG) are typically preferred due to improved render quality and smaller file size.
