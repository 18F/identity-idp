  returnImmediately:
    type: boolean
    description: |-
      An OPTIONAL JSON boolean value that indicates the SET Transmitter SHOULD return an immediate response even if no
      results are available (short polling). The default value is false, which indicates the request is to be treated
      as an HTTP long poll, per [Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6202#section-2) of
      [RFC6202](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8936.html#RFC6202).
      The timeout for the request is part of the configuration between the participants, which is out of scope of this specification.
