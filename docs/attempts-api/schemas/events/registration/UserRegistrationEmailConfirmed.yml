  User clicks on the confirmation link sent to their provided email address. Note: Internally, Login's meaning of a 'confirmed' email is overloaded, and also requires that a password has been set. This event uses the plain-language meaning of 'confirmed': a user clicked the link in an email, showing ownership of the email account.
