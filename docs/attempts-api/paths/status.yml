      description: |
        The 400 (Bad Request) status code indicates that the server cannot or
        will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be
        a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request
        message framing, or deceptive request routing).
    401:
      description: |
        The 401 (Unauthorized) status code indicates that the request has not
        been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for
        the target resource. Please ensure that the request includes a valid Bearer token.
    403: 
      description: |
        The 403 (Forbidden) status code indicates that the server understood
        the request but refuses to authorize it. Please reach out to your account manager
        if you think this is a mistake.
