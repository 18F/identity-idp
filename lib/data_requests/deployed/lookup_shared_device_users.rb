    # This class iteratively looks up networks of users who are sharing devices.
    # It does this by first looking up the devices for a set of users.
    # Then it looks at all of the users who have signed in from those devices.
    # If a user who has not had their devices looked up is present, it looks up
    # the devices for that user.
    # This process is done iteratively until all devices and users within a
    # network are found.
