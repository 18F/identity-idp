# Mobile local development

Instructions to use an iPhone or Android mobile device for local app development, in two sections:

- [§ Use the app from a mobile device](#use-the-app-from-a-mobile-device) by running it over your home or office WiFi
- [§ Debugging with the desktop browser](#debugging-with-the-desktop-browser) by plugging your phone into your computer with a USB cable

## Use the app from a mobile device

These instructions will configure your local copy of the identity-idp app to serve web pages over your local computer network &mdash; the wifi in your home or office. You can broadcast the app to a mobile phone or tablet. Both your mobile device and your development computer (your laptop) must be connected to the same wifi network.

By default, the application binds to `localhost`. These instructions bind to `0.0.0.0` instead. Some Android users report they can access `localhost:3000` directly on their phone, however.

1. Find your Local Area Network IP address. On a MacBook, this is available at **System Preferences → Network**. The address may start with `192.168`.

2. In your app's `application.yml` file, add the below. Be sure to indent these lines and include them in the `development:` section. Also, fill in your actual LAN IP address. The final line creates a **confirm now** link in place of email confirmation.

```yaml
development:
  domain_name: 192.168.x.x:3000
  mailer_domain_name: 192.168.x.x:3000
  enable_load_testing_mode: true
```

3. In the Chrome web browser of your development computer, visit `chrome://inspect`

4. Click on **Port forwarding**. For port `8234` enter `0.0.0.0:3000`. Check **Enable port forwarding** and click **Done**. These screenshots illustrates enabling port forwarding on a MacBook:

5. Start your app's local web server with:

```bash
HOST=0.0.0.0 make run-https
```

6. In the Chrome browser on your phone, open a new incognito tab. In the address bar, type in `https://` (don't forget the `s`) followed by your LAN IP and port number (like `https://192.168.x.x:3000`). When you visit this page, you may see a **Your connection is not private** message. Click **Advanced** and **Proceed** to continue. You should then see the sign in screen of the identity-idp app.

After you complete these steps, pages from the app are served from your development machine to your mobile device, where you may now use the identity-idp app. For front-end development, you may now want to turn on browser development tools per the next section of these instructions.

## Debugging with the desktop browser

After you have completed the [§ Use the app from a mobile device](#use-the-app-from-a-mobile-device) instructions above, you may further want to use your desktop browser's development and dubugging tools.

To do this, you will plug your phone into your laptop. You will need a USB cable. It does not work via WiFi.

### Android / Chrome

These instructions will allow you to debug your phone browser with Chrome DevTools on your development machine. Also, they let you view and interact with your phone's browser screen on your laptop screen or development monitor, which lets you screenshare your development work with coworkers.

1. In your Android phone, turn on USB debugging. This will allow your development computer to connect to your phone.

   **USB debugging** is a setting in the **Developer options** menu. This menu may be hidden on your phone. It can be revealed with a ["magic tap"](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) on the phone **Build number** 7 times.

2. Plug your Android phone into your development computer with a USB cable. (A USB hub may or may not work.) If you see a message on your phone asking you to **Allow USB debugging** click to allow it.

3. Visit `chrome://inspect` in the Chrome browser of your development computer. (It may already be open from the previous set of instructions.) Below the "Remote Target" heading, you should see a listing of all the tabs open on your phone. Find the item on the list that represents the sign in screen of the identity-idp app. It should be at the top of the list.

If you don't see any tabs under the "Remote Target" heading, you may need to try a different method of connecting your phone to your computer. In your terminal, you can run the command `ioreg -p IOUSB` to see what is connected to your USB ports. If your phone is connected to a USB hub but is not listed in the output, try connecting your phone directly to the computer. You could also try using a different USB cable.

4. Click to **inspect** this tab. You should see browser DevTools and a representation of your phone's screen on your development computer, as in this illustration:

### iPhone / Safari

These instructions work only if your development computer is an Apple product. You will need a USB cable with the appropriate "lightning" connector to plug into an iPhone.

1. On your development Apple machine, open the Safari web browser. Go to menu items **Safari → Settings → Advanced** and check **Show Develop menu in menu bar**. (For some OS versions, it may be **Safari → Preferences → Advanced**.) A screenshot:

2. Take a glance at the newly-revealed **Develop** menu item in Safari. Seeing how the menu looks now may help you find your iPhone when it later appears in the menu.

3. On your iPhone, go to **Settings → Safari → Advanced** and turn on Web Inspector. Make sure JavaScript is also on.

4. Plug your iPhone into your development computer with a USB cable. (A USB hub may or may not work.) If you see a message on your phone asking you to **Trust This Computer?** click to trust it.

5. Revisit the Safari **Develop** menu of your laptop. You'll see a menu item that wasn't there before: the name of your phone.

6. Within that menu item, you'll find a list of Safari browser tabs open on your iPhone. To see them, the iPhone must be unlocked, and the Safari browser must be displayed on the phone's screen.

7. Click on the tab you wish to inspect. You will see browser debugging tools like Elements, Console, and Layers. (Unlike the above Android instructions, you will not see a picture of your phone's browser screen on your laptop's screen.)
