# Email Images

This folder contains images for exclusive use by mailer templates. This includes email-specific imagery, and also variants of existing assets.

For example, since [SVG images are not well-supported](https://www.caniemail.com/features/image-svg/) in all email clients, this folder may include rasterized versions of common SVG images.

These images should not be used in application views, since vector images (SVG) are typically preferred.
