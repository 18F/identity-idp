      delete_account_info:
        - Deleting your existing account and creating a new one will allow you
          to use the same email address and set up new authentication methods.
          However, deleting will remove any agency applications you have linked
          to your account and you will need to restore each connection.
        - If you continue, you will first receive an email confirmation.  As a
          security measure, you will receive another email with the link to
          continue deleting your account 24 hours after the initial confirmation
          email arrives.
      info:
        - If you can’t access your account using the authentication methods you
          set up previously, deleting your account and creating a new one is the
          only option.
        - We can’t undo an account delete, so please verify if you have another
          authentication method you can use instead.
